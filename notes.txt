The Apple II font is the best bitmap display font ever, fight me.

The Apple I and early Apple II models used a Signetics 2513 character
generator to display ASCII characters in the range U+0020 to U+005F.
Characters were 5 pixels wide and 7 pixels tall, displayed in a 7-by-8
character cell.  The top scan line is always blank, not the bottom.
These models could only display uppercase letters, not lowercase.

Later Apple II models, including the //e and //gs, used a 2316 ROM
chip that also included lowercase letters and moved the (now mostly)
blank scan line to the bottom row, allowing descenders.  One could
also use a 2716 EPROM in place of the 2316.
